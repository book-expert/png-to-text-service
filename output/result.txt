  "Abstract",
  "In the era of Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.",

  "1. Introduction",
  "In the current technological landscape, dominated by Large Language Models, the way we approach information and data has profoundly changed. These models are capable of producing fluent and context-aware text across a wide range of domains, making them powerful tools for knowledge access, task automation, and decision support. Their impressive generative capabilities, however, come with inherent limitations. Despite these strengths, LLMs are not always the best way to access knowledge, especially in critical, specialized or high-precision domains, because they can sometimes provide incorrect, inconsistent or unverifiable information. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as hallucination, poses significant risks when accuracy and reliability are essential, such as in scientific research, medicine, and education."
